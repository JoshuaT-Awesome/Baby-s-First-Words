# Baby's First Words
A Laravel app to keep track of how many words your toddler knows.

Our son's pediatrician wants him to know at least 50 words by his next visit in October.  
This is a simple app I put together that will tell us which words he knows, 
anything noteworthy (like pointing to his eyes when saying "eyes") and will tell us the total number of words he knows.

This is made with Laravel 5.4 and PHP 7.1.7.
